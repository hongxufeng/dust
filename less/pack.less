// @import statements may be treated differently by Less depending on the file extension:

// If the file has a .css extension it will be treated as CSS and the @import statement left as-is (see the inline option below).
// If it has any other extension it will be treated as Less and imported.
// If it does not have an extension, .less will be appended and it will be included as a imported Less file.
// Examples:

// @import "foo";      // foo.less is imported
// @import "foo.less"; // foo.less is imported
// @import "foo.php";  // foo.php imported as a less file
// @import "foo.css";  // statement left in place, as-is

//## variable 
 @import "theme/var";
//@import "../mixin/reset";

//## mixin
 @import "mixin/clearfix";
 @import "mixin/grid-framework";
 @import "mixin/grid";

//## tools
 @import "utilities";

//## widget
 @import "grid";
 @import "button.less";
